# Copilot Key Remapper

## Overview
**Copilot Key Remapper** is a simple script designed to remap the Copilot key on modern laptops to function as a standard right Control key.  
This tool is especially useful for users who prefer the traditional keyboard layout and functionality.

## Why Use This Tool Instead of PowerToys or Windows Settings?
- **Lighter & Faster:** This script is minimal compared to PowerToys.  
- **One-Click Setup:** No need to dig through multiple settings.  
- **Focused Functionality:** It does one job—remapping the Copilot key—reliably.  

## Features
- Remaps the Copilot key to the right Control key.  
- Easy to use and lightweight.  
- Open-source and customizable.  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/A-4-Atom/CopilotKeyRemap.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd CopilotKeyRemap
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    remap_copilot_key.exe
    ```

## Usage
- Simply run the executable file `remap_copilot_key.exe` to apply the key remapping.  

### Auto-Start with Windows
If you want the script to run automatically every time you start your laptop:
1. Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter.  
2. Copy the `remap_copilot_key.exe` file into the Startup folder.  
3. Now the remapping will load with Windows automatically.  

## Troubleshooting
- **Remap not working?** Try running the script as **Administrator**.  
- **Still not working?** Restart your computer after running the script.  
- **Key behaving strangely?** Remove the file from the Startup folder and restart.
